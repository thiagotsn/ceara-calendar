# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

This project uses **pnpm** (pinned via `packageManager: "pnpm@10.33.0"` in `package.json`). CI uses `pnpm/action-setup@v4`; locally pnpm is auto-provisioned by corepack-aware Node setups (mise, asdf, fnm with corepack) or installed manually.

- `pnpm install` — install deps (use `--frozen-lockfile` in CI).
- `pnpm run build` — compile TypeScript to `dist/` (sources outside `scripts/` are also compiled because `rootDir` is `.`).
- `pnpm run update-calendar` — sync every calendar in the registry. Loads `.env` if present (`node --env-file-if-exists`), then `dist/scripts/update-calendar.js`.
- `pnpm run reset-calendar` — destructive reset for a single calendar; requires `CALENDAR_KEY` (e.g. `ceara`, `world-cup-2026`). Loads `.env` if present.
- `pnpm run clean` — remove `dist/`.
- No test suite is configured (`pnpm test` is a stub).

Local dev: copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in the real values, then `pnpm run build && pnpm run update-calendar`. `.env` is gitignored.

## Runtime configuration

Each calendar in the registry owns its own Google credentials — different calendars can be backed by different service accounts. Credentials are resolved lazily by `resolveCalendar(config)` so a missing or malformed one only fails the calendar that needs it.

Per-calendar env vars (the names are declared in each `CalendarConfig.env` block):

- `<KEY>_CALENDAR_ID` — Google Calendar ID to write to. Required.
- `<KEY>_GOOGLE_KEYS_JSON` — full service account JSON, compact single line. Required. Parsed inline; `client_email` / `private_key` are pulled out for the JWT.
- `<KEY>_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` — optional JWT `subject` for domain-wide delegation. Leave blank if the calendar is shared directly with the service account.

Shared env vars:

- `API_FOOTBALL_ENDPOINT` — RapidAPI host (typically `v3.football.api-sports.io`).
- `API_FOOTBALL_KEY` — RapidAPI key.
- `CALENDAR_KEY` — only consumed by `reset-calendar`; picks which registry entry to reset.

Current per-calendar names:

- `CEARA_CALENDAR_ID`, `CEARA_GOOGLE_KEYS_JSON`, `CEARA_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.
- `WORLD_CUP_2026_CALENDAR_ID`, `WORLD_CUP_2026_GOOGLE_KEYS_JSON`, `WORLD_CUP_2026_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.

In GitHub Actions every value comes from a repo secret of the same name. The reset workflow passes its `calendar` dispatch input through as `CALENDAR_KEY`. Locally, copy `.env.example` to `.env` (gitignored) and fill it in; `node --env-file-if-exists=.env` loads it automatically. That flag requires Node ≥ 22.7 — both workflows pin `node-version: 22`.

Rotating one calendar's SA key only touches that calendar's secret — no shared blob to re-paste.

## Architecture

This is a TypeScript app that mirrors football fixtures into Google Calendars. It runs as two GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

- `update-calendar.yml` — `schedule: '30 * * * *'` (hourly at :30) plus `workflow_dispatch`. Runs `scripts/update-calendar.ts`, which iterates every entry in the calendar registry and upserts fixtures. Per-calendar failures are collected and logged; the job exits 1 if any failed, but one bad calendar does not skip the others.
- `reset-calendar.yml` — `workflow_dispatch` only, with two inputs: `calendar` (choice between registered keys) and `confirm` (must equal the literal string `reset`). Deletes every event in the chosen calendar and re-creates from the current season's fixtures.

Both workflows share `concurrency.group: ceara-calendar` so a destructive reset cannot race with a scheduled update — and the two calendars share the same group, so resets serialize against each other too.

### Calendar registry

`shared/calendars.ts` is the single source of truth for what gets synced. Each `CalendarConfig` has:

- `key` — stable identifier used as the reset workflow's `calendar` input and `CALENDAR_KEY` env var.
- `env` — names of the three env vars to read (`calendarId`, `keysJson`, optional `serviceAccount`). `resolveCalendar(config)` reads and validates them, returning a typed `ResolvedCalendar` containing parsed keys. The Google service is then constructed via `GoogleCalenderService.create({ calendarId, keys, serviceAccount })` — no env reads inside the service itself.
- `source` — discriminated union driving the fetch strategy:
  - `{ kind: 'team', teamId }` — rolling window: queries the API for `currentYear` and `nextYear`, with `from = today-1month` for the current year and the full year range for the next. Existing-events comparison window spans both years.
  - `{ kind: 'league', leagueId, season }` — fixed season: single `/fixtures?league=X&season=Y` call. Existing-events comparison window is the entire `season` year.

Adding a new competition:

1. Add a `CalendarConfig` entry; pick env var names following the `<KEY>_CALENDAR_ID` / `<KEY>_GOOGLE_KEYS_JSON` / `<KEY>_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` pattern.
2. Add a block to `.env.example` and `.env`.
3. Add the three new secrets to GitHub repo settings and reference them in **both** workflows' `env:` blocks (each workflow passes the full set of every calendar's secrets — the script only blows up when a specific calendar tries to run without its env vars).
4. Add the new `key` to the reset workflow's `calendar` `choice` input.

Current entries:

- `ceara` → reads `CEARA_*`, by team `129`.
- `world-cup-2026` → reads `WORLD_CUP_2026_*`, by league `1` season `2026`. Tournament runs 2026-06-11 → 2026-07-19.

### Service composition

```
scripts/{update,reset}-calendar.ts
  └── CalendarConfig from shared/calendars.ts
        └── MatchToCalendarService (services/match-to-calendar)
              ├── ICalendarProvider  ← GoogleCalenderService(calendarId) (services/calendar-provider)
              └── IMatchProvider     ← EspnService (services/match-provider)
```

`MatchToCalendarService.updateCalendar(config)` and `resetCalendar(config)` dispatch on `config.source.kind`. The Google service takes the calendar ID at construction (`GoogleCalenderService.create(calendarId)`) — no more hidden coupling to a single calendar.

### Match provider — per-calendar selection

Each `CalendarConfig.source` carries a `provider: 'espn' | 'sports-api-pro'` discriminator. The scripts pick the right backend via `createMatchProvider(config.source)` (`services/match-provider/factory.ts`). Current assignment:

- `ceara` → **SportsAPI Pro** (`SportsApiProService`, paid API at `v2.football.sportsapipro.com`). ESPN proved unreliable for Ceará fixtures. Reads `SPORTS_API_PRO_KEY` (shared env var). Calls `/api/teams/{id}/near-events` plus `/api/teams/{id}/events/next/0` and dedupes by event ID.
- `world-cup-2026` → **ESPN** (`EspnService`, free unauthenticated endpoints at `site.api.espn.com`).

`ApiFootballDotComService` is kept in the repo as a dormant fallback in case the API-Football account is reinstated. To revive, point the relevant calendar's `provider` at it (after wiring it into the factory).

`shared/calendars.ts` keeps every provider's identifiers populated on each source (API-Football's `teamId`/`leagueId`/`season`, ESPN's `espnTeamId`/`espnPath`/`espnDates`, SportsAPI Pro's `sportsApiProTeamId`) so swapping providers is a one-field change. After swapping, the destination provider's secrets must be valid.

Note: switching providers changes the fixture-ID scheme, so the per-calendar `reset-calendar` workflow must be re-run after the swap to avoid stale events from the previous provider's IDs.

ESPN-specific limitations: the scoreboard endpoint does not return a group-stage matchday number, so WC 2026 group matches render as "Grupo A" (no "Nª rodada" suffix). Knockout matches with undecided participants are labeled with translated placeholder names (e.g., "Vencedor do Grupo A").

SportsAPI Pro-specific notes: `near-events` returns at most one previous + one upcoming event, and `events/next/0` returns the first page of upcoming matches. Past matches older than the most recent one are not re-fetched — they keep whatever data the calendar already has from the last sync that captured them. With the hourly cron, each match transitions through `nextEvent` → `previousEvent` while its final score is still fresh.

### Load-bearing details

- **Event identity**: the fixture ID from API-Football is reused as the Google Calendar event ID (`Event.create` → `event.fixture.id.toString()`). Upserts rely on this — existing events are fetched in the window, then each generated event is matched by `id` to decide insert vs. update. Do not synthesize a different ID scheme.
- **Date handling in `Event.entity`**: matches with status `TBD` or in `StatusExceptions` (postponed, suspended, cancelled, etc.) become all-day events (`date`-only). Otherwise they're timed events in UTC with a hard-coded 2-hour duration (`convertDate(..., offset=2)`). Status drives both the date format and the `summary`/`description` strings (Portuguese labels in `MatchEnum.StatusLabels`).
- **Google auth**: each calendar has its own `google.auth.JWT`. Credentials come from the calendar's own `<KEY>_GOOGLE_KEYS_JSON` env var, scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`. `subject` is the calendar's own `<KEY>_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (only set if you use domain-wide delegation). Otherwise the calendar must be directly shared with the service account email ("Make changes to events"). Different calendars can use entirely separate service accounts from different GCP projects.
- **Error handling**: scripts catch at the top level and `process.exit(1)` on failure so the workflow run shows as failed in GitHub.

## TypeScript notes

- `tsconfig.json` has `strict: false`, no `esModuleInterop`, and targets ES6/CommonJS. Existing code uses non-null assertions and loose typing — match the surrounding style rather than tightening one file in isolation.
- `dayjs` is imported as `import dayjs = require("dayjs")` everywhere because the default-import form needs `esModuleInterop`, which is intentionally off. Use the same form for any new CommonJS-only dep.
